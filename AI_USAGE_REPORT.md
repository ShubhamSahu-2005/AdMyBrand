## Sample Prompts (2-3 examples)

### 1. Component Development
```
"Create a responsive React dashboard component with TypeScript that includes:
- KPI cards showing revenue, users, conversions metrics
- Interactive charts using Recharts library
- Real-time data updates with loading states
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Dark/light theme support
Use shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS for styling."
```

### 2. Problem Solving
```
"I'm getting a hydration error in my Next.js app where the server-rendered HTML doesn't match the client. The issue occurs with dynamic content that depends on window.innerWidth. How can I fix this while maintaining responsive design?"
```

### 3. Code Optimization
```
"Help me optimize this React component for better performance:
- Current component re-renders too frequently
- Large data table with 1000+ rows
- Need to implement virtualization
- Should maintain sorting and filtering functionality
Show me the optimized version with React.memo, useMemo, and react-window."
```
